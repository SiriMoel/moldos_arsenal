A collection of wands/weapons/items from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3093591071]Tales of Kupoli[/url].
Why? I've decided to split Tales into 2 different mods as a remaster and internal rewrite of sorts.

Adds [b]18[/b] new wands & some new spells along with some special drops to find and collect.
